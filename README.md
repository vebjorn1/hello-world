# hello-world

I am a 21 year old philosophy student from Oslo, Norway. 
I have just started learning programming, and I'm having a lot of fun with it (some frustration too, obviously).
From what I've understood, GitHub is the place to be if you want to take part in the developer community. 
Which I very much would like to do. So... here I am, trying to figure this place out.
